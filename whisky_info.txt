			Single malt Scotch whisky must be made from 100% malted barley.

			2) Single-Grain: Made from malted barley and mixture of grain in one distillery
			3) Blended malt Scotch Whisky: Blend 2+ single-malt Scotch whiskies from different distilleries
			4) Blended grain Scotch Whisky: Blend 2+ single-grain Scotch whiskies from different distilleries
			5) Blended Scotch Whisky: Blend 1+ single-malt Scotch whiskies with 1+ single-grain Scotch whiskies from different distilleries

	Ireland:
		Irish whiskey is always spelled with an e – this is a key difference between Irish whiskey and Scotch whisky.
			Irish whiskey uses little or no peat, so there is usually no smokiness in these whiskies. 
			Irish whiskey may contain a distillate of malt, a barley distillate and a portion of grain spirit.
			Irish whiskey is distilled three times.
			Like Scotch whisky, Irish whiskey must be matured for a legal minimum of three years.

	United States:
		BOURBON
			Bourbon is American whiskey that has been made from a minimum of 51% corn with rye and malted barley. Examples of bourbon include Jim Beam and Wild Turkey whiskey.
			Bourbon is a very small area of Kentucky where bourbons were originally produced, but since 1964 American law has stated bourbon can be made anywhere in the USA.
			In Bourbon whiskey, the residue from the pot still is mixed with the mash to create a ‘sour mash’ whiskey.
			Distillation of bourbon usually takes place in a column still and then a pot still, but sometimes only column stills are used – Woodford Reserve operate a triple distillation in pot stills.
			Bourbon spirit is always matured in fresh oak casks, which are charred to yield more flavour.
		RYE WHISKEY
			Rye whiskey is made in the same way as bourbon, but is made up of 51% rye. Examples of rye whiskey include Wild Turkey Rye and Jim Beam Rye.
			Rye whiskies send to be spicier in character.
			Tennessee whiskey is made in the same way as bourbon, but it is charcoal mellowed before maturation.
	Japan:
		Japanese whisky came into being in the 1920s. It was inspired by Scotch whisky – Scottish academic institutions trained the first whisky makers of Japan. This means that the process of making Japanese whisky is very similar to Scotch whisky production, however Japanese whisky has no legal minimal maturation period.
		Most blended Japanese whiskies do use an amount of Scotch malt whisky in their composition – usually this is aged over five years old.
